# Airdrop: auto airdrop to accounts or claim airdrop?
This has been a difficult question for myself for a long time. But, the best option for a chain is to give airdrop only to people who claims airdrop. This way, token is given only to eligible active accounts.

If auto airdrop to accounts, a proportion of that token ends up in inactive accounts which will be wasted. This greatly hurts tokenomic. This is the case that has happened to IONs (of Osmosis where 1/3 of IONs is wasted on inactive accounts) (this is also the case of dig chain)

# What will be done to do airdrop?
A module for airdrop will be built so that claiming airdrop will happen on chain.

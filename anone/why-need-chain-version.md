Different chain binary can lead to the problem of validators unable to achieve state sync

Therefore, all validators need the same version of chain binary

Without the tool to check binary version, this is almost impossible to achieve

Therefore, Anone needs to enable "anoned version" so that validators can check if they use the same version

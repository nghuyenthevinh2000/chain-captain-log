# Metrics (Controllable metric)
The first goal of setting up the whole tracking system is to determine **the single most important** metric needed to track. This will shape how I understand about the product.

1. From PO perspective (internal): 
* User performance: total user (all times), new user (weekly), active user (daily)
* Determine user actions through usage performance

1. From tech perspective (internal):
* Errors metrics
* CPU/RAM usage
* Network latency metrics

1. From user perspective (external)?:
* Listing features, to do 1 features, how many steps it will take? Can the number of steps be reduced further (thanks to tracking each step events)

1. From investor/trader perspective (external) (retailer: 1k+, whale: 500k+)
* Product development performance:
  * Features completion rate: how fast the team can deliver promised features
* Revenue:
  * User performance: total user (all times), new user (weekly), active user (daily)
  * Features usage performance (potential revenue): usage volume (all times - big number; monthly, weekly - growth)
* Profit performance (specific context):
  * Revenue sharing rate (all times - to show case volume; monthly, weekly - growth)

# Verifiable metrics (to prove the number of a product)

1. Third party metrics
